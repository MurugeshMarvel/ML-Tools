This is a collection of jupyter notebooks. If you need help with that, check out our wiki or guides on jupyter.

If you want to work with Tensorflow, feel free to follow their guide, but I've been having a lot more luck using a docker image and jupyter as a way to interact. It's also a great way to share the work youve' done (for verification, too!). For a good image, check out the list on our wiki [here](https://github.com/MycroftAI/ML-Tools/wiki/Tensorflow-Help).

[Vector+Representations+of+Words](https://github.com/MycroftAI/ML-Tools/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Vector%252BRepresentations%252Bof%252BWords.ipynb)
Good for example in vector representation of words. This is really just a jupyter notebook of the tutorial on tensorflows site. You can find that full guide [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec)
